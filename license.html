      <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
      <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
         exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
         and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
         authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
      </p>
      <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
         the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
         scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
         of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
         works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
         and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
         These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
         culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
         works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
         part through the use and efforts of others.
      </p>
      <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
         expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
         associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
         is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
         elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
         terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
         Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Copyright and Related Rights</h3>
      <p>A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
         Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
         limited to, the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
            communicate, and translate a Work;
         </li>
         <li>moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);</li>
         <li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
            likeness depicted in a Work;
         </li>
         <li>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
            subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
         </li>
         <li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
            in a Work;
         </li>
         <li>database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
            European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
            protection of databases, and under any national implementation
            thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
            directive); and
         </li>
         <li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
            world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
            implementations thereof.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>2. Waiver</h3>
      <p>To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
         of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
         irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
         Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
         of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
         future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
         worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
         treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
         medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
         including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
         purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
         member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
         successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall notbe subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the freedom to use, modify, or redistribute the Work in any way.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Public License Fallback</h3>
      <p>Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
         ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to
         the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express
         statement of intent, and the remainder of the Work and the legal rights
         granted to recipients of the Work under this License will not be
         affected.
      </p>
      <p>If no such judicial action is initiated within the applicable time
         period, then the Waiver shall remain in force and effect as if such
         invalid or ineffective provision had never been included in this
         License, and the unenforceable provision shall be replaced with a valid
         and enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying
         the original provision.
      </p>
      <h3>4. License Grant</h3>
      <p>Affirmer hereby grants to each recipient of the Work a worldwide, royalty-free,
         non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license to use, copy, modify,
         distribute, perform, display, and create derivative works of the Work,
         and to distribute and sublicense the Work and derivative works thereof
         under any legal theory, for any purpose, without restriction and without
         any warranty or liability of any kind, including without limitation
         any warranty or liability regarding the existence of any patent rights
         in the Work or any adaptations made to the Work.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>By distributing or communicating the Work, Affirmer represents and warrants
         that, to the best of Affirmer's knowledge, it has sufficient rights in
         the Work to grant the license set forth in this License.
      </p>
      <p>Except as expressly stated in this License, the Work is provided under
         this License on an "AS-IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY OR LIABILITY,
         INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
         FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE WORK
         IS WITH THE USER/RECIPIENT.
      </p>
      <p>THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.
         NO USE OF THE WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
      </p>
      <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL AFFIRMER
         BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
         CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE
         OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>
      <h3>7. Termination</h3>
      <p>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
         upon any breach by Affirmer of the terms of this License. Individuals or
         entities who have received Derivative Works from Affirmer under this
         License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
         individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
         Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
      </p>
      <h3>8. Miscellaneous</h3>
      <p>Each time You distribute or publicly display the Work or a Derivative Work,
         Creative Commons offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
         terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
      </p>
      <p>If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
         law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
         the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
         agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
         to make such provision valid and enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
         consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
         by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
      </p>
      <p>This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
         to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
         representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Affirmer
         shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
         communication from You.
